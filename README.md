## 📌 Project Overview

Cyrax Key Logger is a Python-based educational project that demonstrates how keyboard inputs (keystrokes) can be captured, logged, and managed in a controlled environment. It uses a simple GUI built with Tkinter to start and stop logging safely.

The project helps beginners understand:

* Keyboard event handling
* File operations
* GUI-based control systems
* Basic system-level input monitoring

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.8+**
* **pynput** – for capturing keystrokes
* **tkinter** – for GUI interface
* **Text file logging**
* **Windows / Linux OS**

---

## 📂 Project Files

* `cyrax_keylogger.py` → Main Python source code
* `cyrax_keylog.txt` → Log file where keystrokes are stored
* `README.md` → Project documentation

## ⚙️ Installation Steps

### 1️⃣ Install Python

Download and install Python from:
👉 [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Make sure **Python is added to PATH**.

---

### 2️⃣ Install Required Library

Open Command Prompt / Terminal and run:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

`tkinter` comes pre-installed with Python.

---

### 3️⃣ Download the Project

Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cyrax-key-logger
```

Or manually download the `.py` file.

---

## ▶️ Usage Steps

### 1️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python cyrax_keylogger.py
```

---

### 2️⃣ GUI Interface

* Click **Start Logging** → Keystroke logging begins
* Click **Stop Logging** → Logging stops safely
* Status label updates in real time

---

### 3️⃣ View Logs

All captured keystrokes are stored in:

```
cyrax_keylog.txt
```

The file includes:

* Start time
* Logged keystrokes
* Stop time
